Hi! My name is Mico S. Thepsourinthone. My last name is pronounced "TEP-sir-in-tawn".

Jesus is my Savior. Hayle (prounounced "HAY-lee") is my wife. Lisa is my 10-month
old daughter. Yankee (short for "Yankee-Doodle") is my 6-year old Labradoodle dog.
My favorite hobby is playing chess.

Thanks for taking the time to learn about me!
